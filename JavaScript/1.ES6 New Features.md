# ES 6 New Feature

ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced many new features to JavaScript that significantly enhanced the language. Here are some of the key features:

## 1. Arrow Functions:  A shorter syntax for writing functions using =>.
  ```
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
  ```
## 2. Classes: A more intuitive way to create objects and deal with inheritance.
```
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}
```
## 3. Template Literals: A way to embed expressions inside string literals using backticks (`) and ${} for expressions.
```
const name = 'World';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
```

## 4. Destructuring Assignment: A way to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
```
const [a, b] = [1, 2];
const {name, age} = {name: 'Alice', age: 25};
```

## 5.Rest and Spread Operators: ... is used for both rest parameters in function definitions and spreading elements of an array.
```
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...arr, 4, 5];
```

## 6.Rest and Spread Operators: ... is used for both rest parameters in function definitions and spreading elements of an array.

```
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...arr, 4, 5];
```

## 7.Let and Const: New ways to declare variables with block scope (let) and constants (const).
```
let x = 10;
const y = 20;
```

## 8.Modules: The ability to export and import modules in a cleaner way.
```
// Exporting
export const pi = 3.14;

// Importing
import { pi } from './math.js';
```

## 9.Promises: A better way to handle asynchronous operations.
```
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve('done'), 1000);
});

promise.then(result => console.log(result));
```

## 10.Enhanced Object Literals: Shorter syntax for defining properties and methods in object literals
```
const x = 10;
const y = 20;

const obj = { x, y, greet() { console.log('Hello!'); } };
```
## These features, among others, have made JavaScript more powerful and expressive, making it easier to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
