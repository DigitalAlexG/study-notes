## In Django, if you're using a delete_flg field to indicate whether data is "soft deleted" (i.e., logically deleted rather than physically deleted), you can simplify your queries so that you don't need to manually filter by delete_flg=0 each time. Here's how you can implement this more efficiently by default.

# Solution 1: Custom Manager
By creating a custom Manager, you can modify the default queryset to automatically include a filter for delete_flg=0, so that only active (not deleted) records are returned in all queries.

### Steps:
1. Add the delete_flg field to your model: Add the delete_flg field to indicate whether the data is deleted.
```
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    delete_flg = models.BooleanField(default=False)  # False means active, True means deleted

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
2. Create a custom Manager: Define a custom Manager that overrides the get_queryset() method to filter out deleted records.
```
class ActiveManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter(delete_flg=False)  # Return only active records
```
3.Apply the custom Manager to the model: Replace the default objects manager with the custom one, so all queries automatically exclude logically deleted records.
```
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    delete_flg = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    # Use the custom manager for active records
    objects = ActiveManager()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
4.Access all records (including deleted ones): If you still want to access all records (both deleted and not deleted), you can define another manager that doesn't filter by delete_flg.
```
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    delete_flg = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    # Custom manager for active records only
    objects = ActiveManager()
    # Default manager for all records (including deleted)
    all_objects = models.Manager()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
### With this setup:
+ MyModel.objects.all() will return only active records (delete_flg=False).
+ MyModel.all_objects.all() will return all records, including deleted ones.

# Solution 2: Custom QuerySet
Another option is to create a custom QuerySet with a filter method for active records.

1.Create a custom QuerySet:
```
class MyModelQuerySet(models.QuerySet):
    def active(self):
        return self.filter(delete_flg=False)  # Filter for active records only
```
2.Apply the custom QuerySet to the model: Use the custom QuerySet as the default manager for your model.
```
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    delete_flg = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    objects = MyModelQuerySet.as_manager()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
3.Query the records: By default, you can now use the active() method to get only non-deleted records.
```
active_records = MyModel.objects.active()  # Returns only active records
```
# Summary
+ Solution 1: Using a custom Manager automatically filters all queries to return only active records (delete_flg=False), which simplifies code.
+ Solution 2: Using a custom QuerySet provides more flexibility for filtering, as you can choose when to apply the filter.
