# Self instruction
Hey, I'm Alex. I've been a software engineering for 13 years, specializing in building scalable, user-friendly, functional applications. I'm pretty good at handling tough tech challenges and I really enjoy collaborating with others, sharing my experiences and knowledge to help out. In my free time, I'm into outdoor activities, and Kelowna is perfect for that. That's why I love it here and I'm excited to start working and contribute to Dr. Lai's team at TranqSleep.

# Regarding Leave Request
Hey, on October 4th, my mom's flying from China to Vancouver. Her English isn't good, and I'm concerned about her handling the layover to Kelowna. I'll need to take the day off to drive to Vancouver and pick her up. Should I check with Dr. Lai about how to handle this?

# Spouse's Income on TD1 Form
For the section about my spouse's income on the TD1 form, since she's a PhD student at UBCO with a $2,000 monthly scholarship (which isn't taxed), 
Did her net income would be considered as $0. So, you should enter $0 for her income on the form
