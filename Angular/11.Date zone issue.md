```
onst entryDate = this.datePipe.transform(
                new Date(request.entry_date),
                'yyyy-MM-dd'
              );
```
input: request.entry_date: 2024-10-01
output entryDate:2024-09-30

## The issue likely arises from the behavior of JavaScript's Date object and time zone differences.

## When you create a new Date object using new Date(request.entry_date), JavaScript interprets the date as being in your local time zone by default. If you're in a time zone where the current time is still in the previous day (e.g., it's late at night on 9/30 in UTC), JavaScript may adjust the date to reflect that time zone difference, which results in the entryDate being transformed to 9/30 instead of 10/1.

## Solutions:
### 1.Pass the date as a string in yyyy-MM-dd format instead of using new Date():

```
const entryDate = this.datePipe.transform(request.entry_date, 'yyyy-MM-dd');
```
#### This will avoid the issue of time zone adjustments by not creating a new Date object.

###2. Use UTC Dates: You can force the date to be treated as UTC, ignoring the local time zone, by using the following approach:

```
const entryDate = this.datePipe.transform(
  new Date(request.entry_date + 'T00:00:00Z'),
  'yyyy-MM-dd'
);
```
Adding T00:00:00Z forces the date to be interpreted as UTC at midnight, eliminating time zone offsets.

#### These methods should resolve the issue of the date being shifted due to time zone differences.
