# The key difference between ?? (nullish coalescing operator) and || (logical OR operator) is how they handle "falsy" values. Hereâ€™s an explanation:

## 1. ?? (Nullish Coalescing Operator):
### Purpose: This operator returns the right-hand value only when the left-hand value is null or undefined.
Falsy Values Ignored: It allows other "falsy" values like 0, false, "" (empty string), etc., to be returned from the left-hand side.
### Example:

```
let value = data.total_awake_number ?? 0;
```
### If data.total_awake_number is null or undefined, value will be 0.
### If data.total_awake_number is 0, false, or "", value will still be data.total_awake_number because those are not null or undefined.
## 2. || (Logical OR Operator):
Purpose: This operator returns the right-hand value if the left-hand value is "falsy." Falsy values include null, undefined, 0, false, NaN, and "" (empty string).
Falsy Values Rejected: Any "falsy" value will be ignored, not just null or undefined.
### Example:

```
let value = data.total_awake_number || 0;
```
### If data.total_awake_number is 0, false, null, undefined, or an empty string "", value will be 0.
### This means that even if data.total_awake_number is 0 (a valid number), value will still be set to 0.
### Key Difference:
+ ?? only checks for null and undefined, making it more precise when you want to distinguish between valid "falsy" values (like 0) and truly missing values (null/undefined).
+ || treats any falsy value (including 0, false, and "") as if it were missing.
### Example in Action:
```
let totalAwakeNumber = 0;

// Using nullish coalescing (??)
let result1 = totalAwakeNumber ?? 5; // result1 = 0

// Using logical OR (||)
let result2 = totalAwakeNumber || 5; // result2 = 5
```
+ In the ?? example, totalAwakeNumber is 0, which is not null or undefined, so result1 remains 0.
+ In the || example, totalAwakeNumber is considered "falsy" (because it's 0), so result2 is set to 5.
## Conclusion:
### Use ?? when you want to treat null or undefined as missing values but allow other falsy values (like 0, false) to be valid. Use || when you want to treat any falsy value as if it were missing.
