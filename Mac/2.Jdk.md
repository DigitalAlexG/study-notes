## It seems that you're encountering an error when trying to install python3-virtualenv on your macOS, where the system is mistakenly trying to invoke Java instead of running the Python command. Even though you've installed JDK 21, the system still throws a Java-related error for a Python command. Here’s how you can resolve this issue:

# 1. Verify JDK Installation
First, confirm that JDK is correctly installed by running:

```
java -version
```
This should display the Java version if the JDK is properly installed.

# 2. Check $JAVA_HOME and Path Configuration
Make sure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is correctly set and that the path includes the Java bin directory:

```
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
# 3. Install python3-virtualenv Using Homebrew
On macOS, it’s recommended to use Homebrew for installing Python packages. Instead of using apt, install python3-virtualenv with Homebrew:

```
brew install python@3.11
pip3 install virtualenv
```
# 4. Use pip Instead of apt
You can directly use Python's package manager pip to install virtualenv:

```
pip3 install virtualenv
```
# 5. Check macOS Java Configuration
Sometimes, macOS might incorrectly link certain commands to Java. If you don't need Java for this process, you can temporarily rename or move the Java configuration to avoid interference:

```
sudo mv /usr/libexec/java_home /usr/libexec/java_home_backup
```
### By following these steps, you should be able to correctly install python3-virtualenv without the system mistakenly invoking Java. If the issue persists or you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
