## Error message:
To 'Github URL'
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'Github URL'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. If you want to integrate the remote changes,
hint: use 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

### This error message indicates that the main branch in the remote repository has some commits that your local main branch is behind. You need to first fetch the remote changes to your local repository before attempting to push your changes. Here are the steps to follow:

**1. Fetch Remote Repository Changes**: Pull the changes from the remote repository into your local repository. You can use the command git pull origin main.

```
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```
**2.Resolve Potential Merge Conflicts**: If there are merge conflicts during the pull process, Git will notify you about which files have conflicts. You'll need to manually resolve these conflicts and then use the git add command to mark the resolved files as staged.

```
git add <conflicted_file>
```
**3.Commit the Merge Result**: After resolving all conflicts and staging the resolved files, commit the merge result.

```
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```
**4.Push Changes to Remote Repository:** Now you can push your local changes to the remote repository.

```
git push origin main
```
### Here's a complete example workflow:

```
cd /path/to/your/project
git init
git checkout -b main
git remote add origin https://github.com/DigitalAlexG/Kids_Coding.git
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
# Resolve merge conflicts if any
# git add <conflicted_file>
# git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```
### These steps will help you synchronize your local main branch with the remote repository, resolve any conflicts, and successfully push your changes.
