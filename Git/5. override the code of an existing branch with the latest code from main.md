# Override the code of an existing branch with the latest code from main, follow these steps:

## 1. Ensure You’re on the Right Branch
Switch to the branch you want to override:

```
git checkout your-branch
```
## 2. Reset the Branch to main
If you want to completely override your branch with main, use:
```
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```
This completely replaces your branch with main.
Warning: Any local changes in your-branch will be lost.

333. Force Push (If Needed)
If you want to update the remote branch as well:
```
git push --force
```
⚠️ Be careful with --force, as it overwrites remote history.

## Alternative: Merge Instead of Overriding
If you just want to update your branch without deleting history:
```
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```
or use rebase:
```
git rebase origin/main
```
This keeps your commits but applies main's changes on top.
