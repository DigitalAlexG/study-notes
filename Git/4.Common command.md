## 1. Set Up Git (If Not Done Yet)
If you haven’t set up Git:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

## 2. Clone the Repository
If you don’t have the local repository:
```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

## 3. Update Local Code (Sync with Remote)
First, ensure you’re on the main branch (usually main or master):
```
git checkout main   # or git checkout master
git pull origin main
```

## 4.Create a Sub-Branch (Feature or Bugfix Branch)
Create a new branch off the updated main branch:
```
git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
```

## 5. Make Changes to the Code
Edit, add, or delete files as needed.

## 6. Stage and Commit Changes
Check the status of changes:
```
git status
```
Stage specific files:
```
git add filename
```
Or stage all changes:
```
git add .
```
Commit changes with a clear message:
```
git commit -m "Add login page with validation"
```

## 7.Push the Sub-Branch to Remote
Push your new branch to the remote repository:
```
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

## 8. Create a Pull Request (PR)
Go to your GitHub/GitLab repository and create a Pull Request from your branch into main.

Add a clear title and description.
Request reviews if necessary.

## 9. Merge and Clean Up (After PR Approval)
Switch to main and pull the latest changes:
```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
Merge your branch (if not done through the PR interface):
```
git merge feature/your-branch-name
```
Delete the local branch:
```
git branch -d feature/your-branch-name
```
Delete the remote branch (optional):
```
git push origin --delete feature/your-branch-name
```
