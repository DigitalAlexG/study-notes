# Tight Coupling and Loose Coupling in Java
In software engineering, coupling refers to the degree of dependency between one module and another. Coupling can be classified into tight coupling and loose coupling. These concepts are crucial in Java development as they affect code maintainability, scalability, and testability.

## Tight Coupling
Tight coupling refers to a situation where one class or module is highly dependent on the implementation details of another class or module. This means if one module changes, the dependent module may also need to be modified accordingly. Tight coupling reduces code flexibility and maintainability.

### Example
```
// Tight Coupling Example: Tightly coupled Car and Engine classes
class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine(); // Tight coupling, as Car directly depends on Engine
    }

    public void startCar() {
        engine.start();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startCar();
    }
}
```
## Loose Coupling
Loose coupling refers to a situation where one class or module has minimal dependencies on the implementation details of another class or module. This is typically achieved through interfaces or abstract classes, allowing one module to be modified independently of the other. This increases code flexibility and maintainability.

### Example
```
// Loose Coupling Example: Using interfaces to achieve loose coupling between Car and Engine classes
interface Engine {
    void start();
}

class DieselEngine implements Engine {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Diesel engine started");
    }
}

class ElectricEngine implements Engine {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Electric engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine; // Loose coupling, dependency through interface
    }

    public void startCar() {
        engine.start();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Engine dieselEngine = new DieselEngine();
        Car carWithDieselEngine = new Car(dieselEngine);
        carWithDieselEngine.startCar();

        Engine electricEngine = new ElectricEngine();
        Car carWithElectricEngine = new Car(electricEngine);
        carWithElectricEngine.startCar();
    }
}
```
## Comparison of Tight Coupling and Loose Coupling
### Tight Coupling:

+ Higher dependency, changes in code may cause a chain reaction of required modifications.  
+ Harder to perform unit testing, as tests need to consider multiple modules.  
+ Harder to reuse, as the code relies on specific implementations.
### Loose Coupling:

+ Lower dependency, easier to make independent changes to the code.  
+ Easier to perform unit testing, as each module can be tested independently.  
+ Easier to reuse, as the code relies on abstractions rather than specific implementations.
