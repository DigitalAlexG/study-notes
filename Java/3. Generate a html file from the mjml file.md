# To use MJML to create HTML for your password reset email, you need to complete these steps:
## 1.First, install MJML dependencies if not already done:
```
npm install
```

## 2.Compile your MJML file to HTML:
```
npm run build:email
```
This will process all MJML files in the src/main/resources/email/ directory, including your reset-password-code.mjml file, and output corresponding HTML files to the same directory.
